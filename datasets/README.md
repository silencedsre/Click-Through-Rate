## `train.csv` and `test.csv` should be inside `datasets/data`

## `train_sample.csv` and `test_sample.csv` will be generated from `data_preprocessing.py` inside `datasets/data`

## `processed_train.csv` and `processed_test.csv` will be generatedfrom `data_preprocessing.py` inside `datasets/data` from respective samples

## `train_ffm.txt` and `test_ffm.txt` will be generated from`data_preprocessing.py` inside `datasets/data_libffm` from respective processed csv

## `model.out` the trained model will be generated from `model.py` inside `datasets/trained_model` (run this only after data_preprocessing)

## `output.txt` final output will be generated from `model.py` inside `datasets/output`
